                <h2>Top private 5G use cases and benefits in the enterprise.</h2>
                <h3>George Lawton <br> 09 Dec 2020</h3>

                <p class="para">
                    Much of the industry hype surrounding 5G centers on its ability to deliver blazingly fast speeds for consumer applications. However, CIOs should take note of the potential of 5G to transform private networking infrastructure. It promises higher speeds,
                    lower latency and stronger connections than existing commercial services like 4G or private infrastructure such as Wi-Fi and some enterprises are already deploying private 5G use cases to prove its value.</p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2>Private 5G use cases in the enterprise</h2>
                    Enterprises will need to decide how to provision the private 5G use cases that deliver real-world ROI, but several are already starting to explore -- and in some cases even deploy them. The following are eight of the early private 5G use cases already
                    proving valuable in the enterprise</p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2>1. Upgrading 4G</h2>
                    5G is currently more of a proof of concept that will likely take several years before it reaches a point of mainstream adoption.<br>"Very few enterprises are asking ISG for support in building out private 5G networks," said David Lessin,
                    director of network operations and research at global technology research and advisory firm ISG. This is likely due to the historical patterns of mobile operators setting up network infrastructure at their own cost. "Their perception
                    is there isn't enough 5G deployment to consider the possibilities yet," Lessin said.
                </p>
                <h2>2. Domain specific services </h2>
                Another private 5g use case that companies should take note of involves exploring opportunities to provide new services that combine domain expertise, systems integration, networking and physical infrastructure. This will be particularly important for
                applications that combine operational technology (OT) and IT in new ways such as industrial automation, factories and energy.
                <p class="para">
                    <h2> 3. Campus networks</h2>
                    According to Lessin, 5G campus networks, or private 5G, are one of the major areas of investment for telecommunication companies like Deutsche Telekom, where the provider worked and co-innovated with its partners and customers to make the technology stable.
                    The expectations for these networks have gone beyond just improving cellular coverage to exploring new features like IoT coordination and AR.</p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2>4. Healthcare</h2>
                    There are very few types of facilities that have higher device population densities than in healthcare, Lessin said. Security is also at a premium -- by harvesting generated data and combining it with AI, the potential to improve healthcare is limitless.
                    Trends and anomalies that would otherwise go unnoticed could lead to improvements in patient safety and outcomes.

                    <br>The high reliability of 5G could also make it easier to ensure access to improved mobile connectivity for safety critical equipment as it moves around facilities.
                </p>
                <h2> 5. Manufacturing</h2>
                Factories today have a wide range of wired and wireless networking infrastructure. Private 5G could play a key role in improving the density and performance of robotics, autonomous vehicles and other automation technologies in the factory. This will be
                critical for enabling robots to work closer to humans. In many cases, robots and humans are kept separate for safety reasons or they are slowed down to reduce the risk of injury.</p>
                <p class="para">
                    <p class="para">
                        <h2>6. Oil and gas</h2>
                        Oil and gas facilities are likely to be another early adopter of private 5G networks because many of their facilities are located outside the range of commercial networks. For example, Accenture has been working with AT&T to deploy a private LTE network,
                        upgradeable to 5G, at a refinery for Phillips 66.<br> "Currently Wi-Fi is typically used as a wireless solution, but there are coverage issues across an entire refinery or campus, not to mention ongoing
                        maintenance complexity," Wang said. The partnership is exploring unlocking a variety of private 5G use cases around worker safety, predictive maintenance and enhanced training.</p>
                    <p class="para">

                        <h2> 7. Smart facilities</h2>
                        5G will enable large venues such as stadiums and malls to explore various 5G private use cases around smart facilities that blend AI and IoT in new ways. "Private 5G networks supporting ubiquitous IoT devices -- some of them running sophisticated AI algorithms
                        -- will transform the operation of buildings, factories and semipublic spaces like stadiums and event venues," said Dirk Mersch, managing director at Cambridge Innovation Consulting.<br> According to Mersch,
                        one challenge is obtaining spectrum approval because of concerns about interference with public networks, even though 5G can be configured to operate over relatively short range. However, many of these deployments may be paused
                        until after the pandemic.</p>
